# Pose-Transfer-with-GAN

This project aims to alter human upper body pose in image by training the GAN and using YouTube pose dataset. The generator model is a modular architecture which has four modules i.e source image segmentation, spatial transformation, foreground synthesis and background synthesis and this was implemented using UNet architecture.

The project is based on a CVPR paper "Sythesizing images of human in unseen poses".
